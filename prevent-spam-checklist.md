# How to prevent your E-Mails from going to Spam Folders

## Whitelists
Hotmail and Yahoo do have whitelists for which you can register.
They check the domain you registered, and the mails the users of yahoo and hotmail already received from that Domain. if the "Spam" - "No Spam" ratio fits, your request gets accepted and your Mail will get a higher "no-spam" ranking when their Spam Checker examine the messages coming from your domain.

Being on such a whitelist is no guarantee that your mails won't get into the spam folder.

## Delay messages
If your mailing lists are really long, or your daily activity of users which trigger mails to be sent is really high, you should start queueing these E-Mails and only let them drop out one by one with a specific delay.

More than 1000 Mails per hour per Mailserver (GMail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.) from the same domain will almost always trigger the Spam Flag.

### Split Mailing lists
Really big mailing lists should be splitted apart in smaller ones, with the mail providers mixed and distributed evenly. (NOT One mailing list per provider, mix them up and distribute them equally ....).
Send your Mail you want to send, to all of those small email lists, but distributed on matters of daytime.
Because if it happens that your mail gets flagged on Gmail f.e., the "peak" for Google to notice that your E-Mails have been marked as spam isn't that high, it's distributed over the day. This makes it more likely that subsequent mails will still pass, even though some users marked them as spam.

### Mailing list clean ups
Big mail providers like Gmail and Hotmail often use transfer errors also as indicator to know if you are sending spam or not. When E-Mails can't be transfered to the user, because the E-Mail Adress doesn't exist anymore, the server will respond with a soft-bounce telling you what went wrong during the delivery of the e-mail.
If too many delivery-failures are triggered from your domain, Google and other Providers are more likely to treat your mails as spam.

So you should try to clean up your mailing lists whenever you notice that you get a lot of soft bounces back, or even for applications that send scheduled e-mails implement a algorithm which keeps track of those soft-bounces and won't include the E-Mail adress in  the next requests anymore.

## Unsubscribe Button
SpamCheckers look explicitly for a way to "opt-out" of your E-Mail service. If they can't find any, your spam score gets worse.
So you should always provide a clear way, to the User in your HTML Markup to opt-out of your E-Mail service easily, so that they don't have to use the spam button to get rid of you E-Mails.
Most of the time a link in the footer stating "Unsubscribe", "Abmelden" is enough to convince the SpamChecker, but it also has to be easy for the user, otherwise he will still flag your Mail as spam, because it's more convenient for him.

## Get in the Adress book
If you can get your user to add you to his addressbook, you've won definitely. Because this more or less guarantees that your Mails won't be thrown into the Spam folder.
A good opportunity to ask the user is during the registration process / in the confirmation mail or via the small print in the footer.

A good idea is to split your mails onto two mail adresses, one for personal informations and one for marketing.
So that when the user confirms to add you to his addressbook he doesn't have to give you  permissions for your marketing e-mails to land into his inbox also.

## Test outgoing E-Mails for important providers
Before going live, or before sending out mail-marketing stuff to your users try your mail content first on the most common Mail Providers like Gmail, Hotmail, etc. and also use some of the mail-testers, to first tell if the mail is spam or not. Because when your campaign is sent, there is not return, and you can't correct anything afterwards.

## Know your E-Mail Templates
SpamChecker do know how bad HTML Markup looks like, and they are actively searching for it.
Never use HTML Markup which is being generated by some kind of WYSIWYG Editor or Microsoft Word - Copy Paste.
Mail-Templates should always be developed by Web-Devs, with a focus on clean HTML Markup.

## Never do: Too much images
Mail filter check your mail for spam. If they can't find any content to check for (text-content) and there are almost only images in the mail, the mail checker assumes the worst and will most likely mark you as spam.

##### Rule of thumb:
At least have 5 lines of text per image.

## Don't sound like a spammer
 * Don't use the word "free" too often
 * Never use ALLCAPS - anywhere
 * N O   S P A C E S   B E T W E E N   C H A R S
 * Keep your text styling simple, don't use fancy colors or fonts.
  * Don't use the color Red too much.
 * Never use exclamation marks, dots or questionmarks in the Subject
  * Only one exclamation mark, dot, questionmark per sentence.
 * Stay away from words used by spammers: "viagra", "drugs", "porn", "guaranteed winner", "buy now", "click here", "double your money", "Get paid", "Satisfaction Guaranteed", "mega"

***"PLEASE BUY MY FREE  V I A G R A  !!1!!!11" <= Really bad***

If you've seen it used in a spam message that you received, don't use it in your own email message!

## From und Reply to
The information "From" and "Reply-To" in the E-Mail Header have to be consistent.
 1. they have to point to the same email address
 2. It has to be relevant to the company.
  * no-reply@netural.com <--- Good
  * office@netural.com <---- Also good
  * webdev-frontend-1@netural.com <---- Not so good

### Provide a real "Reply-To" Adress
The address of the most business e-mails provided in the mail Headers "From" and "Reply-To" look like "no-reply@example.com"
Make sure this address does in fact exist! SpamChecker check for the authenticity and existence of that adress using SPF and DKIM Checks.
If that address does not exist, or the authenticity can't be guaranteed it is an indicator for the spam filter.

### Links
Links, just as Images should be used sparely. Only include as many links as absolutely needed.
Links have to be fully specified, and you are not allowed to use URL-Shorteners.


### Speak to the user, if you know him
If you know anything about the user, that probably his hosting provider also knows about him, include it in the email address.
F.e. First- and Lastname if known should be included as metadata in the "To" - Header of the mail, as well as in the content body.

### Don't use JavaScript or Flash in your Templates
If you want to include videos of stuff like that in your E-Mail, don't use some kind of flash or Javascript. Instead include a picture of the video player, with the teaser of your video you want to display and embedd it into a link.

### Try to avoid attachments
Better: Self-host your attachments and give the user the option to download it using a Call-To-Action Button in your E-Mail. Using this method the spam checker doesn't have to analyze the file and probably also pass it through an AntiVirus Software (Windows) which could raise false positives.

### Spellcheck the Mails
As most of the spam mails contain tons of wrongly spelled and written words and sentences, spamcheckers are looking out for your words, comparing them to big dictionaries.
If those spam Filter find too many wrongly spelled words, or sentences they can directly identify with spam, your spam score gets worse.

### Alt - Attributes for pictures
Alt attributes should be set on all linked images. Not only that spam checkers watch out for those tags, but also it makes the readability of the mail better if the user deactiviated lazy loading of images on his client.
