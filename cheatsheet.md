Backwards compatibility breaking changes . non-backwards compatibility breaking features . non-backwards compatibility breaking bugfixes & patches

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

# S.O.L.I.D.

* Single responsibility principle  
 a class should have only a single responsibility (i.e. only one potential change in the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class)

* Open/closed principle  
"software entities … should be open for extension, but closed for modification."

* Liskov substitution principle  
“objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.” See also design by contract.

* Interface segregation principle  
"many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface."

* Dependency inversion principle  
one should "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
